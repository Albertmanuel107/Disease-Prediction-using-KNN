# Disease-Prediction-using-KNN
A machine learning project for disease prediction using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This repository includes the dataset, the Python script for the KNN model, and a detailed explanation of the methodology. The project aims to predict potential diseases based on user-inputted symptoms.

# What you can do with my repository?

This repository is intended to show a simple yet functional KNN model. Its perfect for those who wants to know the basic of machine learning.
In addition, you can try to tweak/experiments with the KNN model further as my model isn't all perfect.

# WARNING!

This is just a demonstration of KNN model in the field of healthcare. I strongly advise you to not use my code in real world application or professional means in healthcare as it is not intended for that. All of the risks caused by this is not on my watch and responsibility.
